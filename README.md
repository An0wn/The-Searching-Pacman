# The-Searching-Pacman
In this project, the Pac-Man agent finds paths through its maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. Search algorithms such as Depth First Search, Bread First Search, Uniform Cost Search and A-star search are applied to Pac-Man scenarios.
